# EisenhowerMatrixToDo
Helps users to create a todo list based on the Eisenhower matrix. I made this to help users with organization and time management. This app helped me to better understand how to take a big problem and divide it to smaller ones. I also learned a lot with lists. One challenge that I had was I would see some tasks being duplicated, so I used the debugging tool on vscode to help me figure out where the bug was coming from and to fix it.
